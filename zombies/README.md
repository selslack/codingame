My solution for CodinGame's Code vs Zombies contest.

I started with simple solution based on zombie threat levels. Next, I decided to apply MCTS here (never done that before!), so I implemented complete game simulation and the basic movement generators. That took me to 110k points and the 22nd rank.

I finished the contest with the d1155b94f0652304e3f2ec229d0f37e46d266b8b solution and the 51st rank.

After that (since I can do local simulations) I tried to improve my solution with genetics as well as MCTS improvements to the number and quality of playouts.
